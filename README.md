Dev Setup
=========

Linux instructions
------------------
1. Install Git

...`sudo apt-get install -y git-core` 

2. Install node, npm and basic software, which are part of an install script (thanks to Coursera).

...Get the setup script by executing below command (*Assumption*: You have already setup a github account)
...`git clone https://github.com/startup-class/setup.git`

3. Execute `setup.sh` to build the dev environment on the Ubuntu server as below

...`./setup/setup.sh`

4. Type "exit" at the prompt, after the above installation and again log back on to Ubuntu.  You can use Cygwin. Use `ifconfig` on Ubuntu to find out the ip address assigned by VirtualBox and use below command
.... `ssh <userid>@<ipaddress of Ubuntu on virtualbox`


Your command prompt should have a *different color* now
